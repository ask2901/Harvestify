## Features

- Developed a web application for disease detection and fertilizer prediction, with integrated e-commerce functionality
- Fully responsive front-end using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, and implemented the back-end using Node.js and Flask.
- Integrated a machine learning model ResNet-50 for disease classification, achieving 38+ disease class identification with
an 87,000+ image dataset. and accuracy of 96%
- Engineered a fertilizer recommendation system using a Naive Bayes classifier based on N-P-K and pH data
- I leveraged the Neurelo Data API to interface with MongoDB database, enabling efficient management of CRUD
operations and the linking of multiple databases

## Tech Stack

## 2. PLANT DISEASE CLASSIFICATION USING RESNET-9 
### **Description of the dataset üìù**
This dataset is created using offline augmentation from the original dataset. The original PlantVillage Dataset can be found¬†here.This dataset consists of about 87K rgb images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 38 different classes. The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure. A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purpose.<br/>
### Libraries used
1. Numpy
2. Pandas 
3. Pytorch
<br/>
We have have use Pytorch here so it have 5 step life cycle<br/>
The five steps in the life-cycle are as follows:<br/>
1. Prepare the Data.
2. Define the Model.
3. Train the Model.
4. Evaluate the Model.
5. Make Predictions.

### Deep Learning Algorithm used- ResNet-9
In ResNets, unlike in traditional neural networks, each layer feeds into the next layer, we use a network with residual blocks, each layer feeds into the next layer and directly into the layers about 2‚Äì3 hops away, to avoid over-fitting (a situation when validation loss stop decreasing at a point and then keeps increasing while training loss still decreases). This also helps in preventing¬†vanishing gradient problem¬†and allow us to train deep neural networks. Here is a simple residual block:

<br/>
The accuracy of the model is 99.2%

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
